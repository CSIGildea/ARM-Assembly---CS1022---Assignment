### Where to start...

Please read the specification, then read, Public - CS1022 - Computing II Assignment - Conor Gildea - gildeaco.pdf,

to aid in understanding, my solution to the given problem and the extra miles I completed for this assignment.

As ARM Assembly is extremely low-level please make sure to make use of the psuedocode I provided in each program.

Note: Psuedocode is completed in near perfect Java.

### Key Features of this Project

- Addressing and editing values stored in different memory addresses

- Calculating location of pixel being edited

### To Current TCD CS First Year Students

Please avoid copying any of this work, you are only cheating yourself by not completing the assignments on your own.

It is much more beneficial to try these assignments yourself, especially for your exams in June.
